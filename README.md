### Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
Welcome to the User Documentation page for Group 4’s final project, Blackjack. This document will walk you through the installation process, navigating the in-game menus, and how to play your first round of Blackjack! Our game was built using the Godot game engine and requires a Windows desktop or laptop in order to play natively. 
</p>

### Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Downloading the game

<p>
The first step to playing our game is to open the internet browser of your choosing and navigate to our GitHub page (if you're reading this, you're already there) where the game’s .zip file is located. 
</p>

<p>
In the right margin, click on the latest release under the “**Releases**” tab and download the .zip file. 
</p>

#### Launching the game

<p>
Locate the downloaded .zip file and move it to a safe/desired location. You will then need to unpack the .zip to your desired location to find the .exe inside. Finally, you can then double click on the .exe file to launch the game!
</p>

### Main Menu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
After launching the game, you will first be greeted with the main menu. Here you will see a few sub-menus we recommend you take a look at before heading into your first game. Those include the “How to Play” and “Settings” menus.
