# Group 4 Final Project - SDEV 265

## Blackjack by: Matt McMahon, Riley Poulin, Brody Rines, Juan Silva, & Aaron Stichter

## Introduction

<p>
Welcome to the User Documentation page for Group 4’s final project, Blackjack. This document will walk you through the installation process, navigating the in-game menus, and how to play your first round of Blackjack! Our game was built using the Godot game engine and requires a Windows desktop or laptop in order to play natively. 
</p>

## Installation

### *Downloading the game*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
The first step to playing our game is to open the internet browser of your choosing and navigate to our GitHub page (if you're reading this, you're already there) where the game’s .exe file is located. 
</p>

<p>
First, click on the "Exported" folder, then on the blackjack.exe file within. On the right hand side, click on the download symbol to "download raw file". Wait a few seconds for the file to finish downloading. 
</p>

### *Launching the game*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
Locate the downloaded .exe file and move it to a safe/desired location. You can then double click on the .exe file to launch the game!
</p>

## Main Menu

<p>
After launching the game, you will first be greeted with the main menu. Here you will see a few sub-menus we recommend you take a look at before heading into your first game. Those include the “How to Play” and “Settings” menus. 
</p>

### *Settings Menu*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
The settings menu gives a few customization options to help optimize your experience. Here you will find a Fullscreen/Windowed toggle, a resolution option and a volume slider.
</p>

### *How to Play Menu*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
The “How to Play” menu lays out the rules of classic Blackjack, as well as how to place your bets within our game. We will also walk through the rules in the next section of this document. 
</p>

## Rules

### *Objective*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
Your objective is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21 points yourself. Each card the dealer passes to you will award a number of points.
  - Numbered cards (2-10) are worth their labeled number (2 is worth 2 points, 10 is worth 10)
  - Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points each
  - Ace cards are worth either 1 or 11 points and are up to the player to decide their value
</p>

### *Starting a Game*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
From the main menu, press Play to start a game. You will begin with an opportunity to place a bet with our fake in-game currency, represented with chips. If you beat the dealer’s hand without busting (going over 21), you will receive a 1:1 reward (if you bet one chip, you will receive your original chip plus one extra chip back). 
</p>

### *Passing Out Cards*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
The dealer will shuffle the cards, pass one card to the player face-up, and one card to themselves face-down. The dealer will next pass an additional card to the player, then to themselves, both face-up this time. 
</p>

### *Stay or Put?*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
Based on the player’s own point total and the value of the dealer’s one face-up card, the player must determine if they will stay or put. Staying means telling the dealer you do not want another card to be added to your total. Putting means requesting another card. Players may draw as many cards as they like until they hit 21 or go over (bust). 
</p>

### *Game Over*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>
If the player busts, the round is over and the player’s bet is lost. If the player stays without going over 21, the dealer will then reveal their second card. If the player has a higher point total, they win the round. If the player’s total matches or is under the dealer’s total, the player loses the round. Bets will be paid out, and a new round will begin! 
</p>
